    FIN:  1 bit

      Indicates that this is the final fragment in a message.  The first
      fragment MAY also be the final fragment.

   RSV1, RSV2, RSV3:  1 bit each

      MUST be 0 unless an extension is negotiated that defines meanings
      for non-zero values.  If a nonzero value is received and none of
      the negotiated extensions defines the meaning of such a nonzero
      value, the receiving endpoint MUST _Fail the WebSocket
      Connection_.

   Opcode:  4 bits

      Defines the interpretation of the "Payload data".  If an unknown
      opcode is received, the receiving endpoint MUST _Fail the
      WebSocket Connection_.  The following values are defined.

      *  %x0 denotes a continuation frame

      *  %x1 denotes a text frame

      *  %x2 denotes a binary frame

      *  %x3-7 are reserved for further non-control frames

      *  %x8 denotes a connection close

      *  %x9 denotes a ping

      *  %xA denotes a pong

      *  %xB-F are reserved for further control frames

   Mask:  1 bit

      Defines whether the "Payload data" is masked.  If set to 1, a
      masking key is present in masking-key, and this is used to unmask
      the "Payload data" as per Section 5.3.  All frames sent from
      client to server have this bit set to 1.

   Payload length:  7 bits, 7+16 bits, or 7+64 bits

      The length of the "Payload data", in bytes: if 0-125, that is the
      payload length.  If 126, the following 2 bytes interpreted as a
      16-bit unsigned integer are the payload length.  If 127, the
      following 8 bytes interpreted as a 64-bit unsigned integer (the
      most significant bit MUST be 0) are the payload length.  Multibyte
      length quantities are expressed in network byte order.  Note that
      in all cases, the minimal number of bytes MUST be used to encode
      the length, for example, the length of a 124-byte-long string
      can't be encoded as the sequence 126, 0, 124.  The payload length
      is the length of the "Extension data" + the length of the
      "Application data".  The length of the "Extension data" may be
      zero, in which case the payload length is the length of the
      "Application data".

   Masking-key:  0 or 4 bytes

      All frames sent from the client to the server are masked by a
      32-bit value that is contained within the frame.  This field is
      present if the mask bit is set to 1 and is absent if the mask bit
      is set to 0.  See Section 5.3 for further information on client-
      to-server masking.

   Payload data:  (x+y) bytes

      The "Payload data" is defined as "Extension data" concatenated
      with "Application data".

   Extension data:  x bytes

      The "Extension data" is 0 bytes unless an extension has been
      negotiated.  Any extension MUST specify the length of the
      "Extension data", or how that length may be calculated, and how
      the extension use MUST be negotiated during the opening handshake.
      If present, the "Extension data" is included in the total payload
      length.

   Application data:  y bytes

      Arbitrary "Application data", taking up the remainder of the frame
      after any "Extension data".  The length of the "Application data"
      is equal to the payload length minus the length of the "Extension
      data".

       data" defined in the same section as frame-payload-data, which
       includes "Extension data" and "Application data".

       The masking key is a 32-bit value chosen at random by the client.
       When preparing a masked frame, the client MUST pick a fresh masking
       key from the set of allowed 32-bit values.  The masking key needs to
       be unpredictable; thus, the masking key MUST be derived from a strong
       source of entropy, and the masking key for a given frame MUST NOT
       make it simple for a server/proxy to predict the masking key for a
       subsequent frame.  The unpredictability of the masking key is
       essential to prevent authors of malicious applications from selecting
       the bytes that appear on the wire.  RFC 4086 [RFC4086] discusses what
       entails a suitable source of entropy for security-sensitive
       applications.

       The masking does not affect the length of the "Payload data".  To
       convert masked data into unmasked data, or vice versa, the following
       algorithm is applied.  The same algorithm applies regardless of the
       direction of the translation, e.g., the same steps are applied to
       mask the data as to unmask the data.

       Octet i of the transformed data ("transformed-octet-i") is the XOR of
       octet i of the original data ("original-octet-i") with octet at index
       i modulo 4 of the masking key ("masking-key-octet-j"):
         j = i MOD 4
         transformed-octet-i = original-octet-i XOR masking-key-octet-j

       The payload length, indicated in the framing as frame-payload-length,
       does NOT include the length of the masking key.  It is the length of
       the "Payload data", e.g., the number of bytes following the masking
       key.
